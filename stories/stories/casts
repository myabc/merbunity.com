Story: All things relating to setting up and using casts

  As a user of merbasts 
  I want to do things with casts
  So that merbcasts can have casts
  
  Scenario: Anonymous user visits the Casts New action
    Given an anonymous user
  
    
  
  Scenario: Upload a cast as an anonymous author
  
  Scenario: Upload a cast as an active author
    Given an active author
  
    When the user visits /casts/new

    Then the visitor should see the page: Casts new
    And the page should match the selector once: form[@action="/casts/"][@enctype="multipart/form-data"][@method="post"]
    And the page should have an input named: cast[title]

  Scenario: Upload a cast as an active publisher
