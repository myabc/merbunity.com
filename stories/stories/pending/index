Story: All things relating to setting up and using casts

  As a author of merbasts 
  I want to do things with pending casts
  So that merbcasts can have active casts
  
  Scenario: A clean casts table with some test data
    Given no current casts in the database
    And an active author named: joe
    And 13 current pending casts in the database
    And 14 current published casts in the database
  
  Scenario: An anonymous author visits the pending index
    GivenScenario A clean casts table with some test data
    And an anonymous author
    
    When the author visits /pending
    
    The author should be redirected to: /login
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the pending index
    GivenScenario A clean casts table with some test data
    
    When the author visits /pending
    
    Then the controller should show 13 pending casts
    And the controller should show 0 published casts
  
  Scenario: An active publisher visits the pending page
    GivenScenario A clean casts table with some test data
    And an active publisher named: harold
  
    When the author visits /pending
  
    Then the controller should show 13 pending casts
    And the controller should show 0 published casts
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the pending index should only see casts they own
    GivenScenario A clean casts table with some test data
    And an active author named: fred
    And 5 current pending casts in the database
    And an active author named: joe
    
    When the author visits /pending
    
    Then the controller should show 13 pending casts
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the show page of a pending cast they authored
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the show page of a pending cast they did not author
  
  Scenario: An active publisher visits the show page of a pending cast they did not author
