Story: All things relating to setting up and using casts

  As a author of merbasts 
  I want to do things with pending casts
  So that merbcasts can have active casts
  
  Scenario: An anonymous author visits the pending index
    Given an active author named: joe
    And 1 current pending casts in the database
    And using the first cast found belonging to: joe
    And an anonymous author
    
    When the author visits /pending
    
    The author should be redirected to: /login
    
    
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the pending index
  
  Scenario: An active publisher visits the pending page
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the show page of a pending cast they authored
  
  Scenario: An active author visits the show page of a pending cast they did not author
  
  Scenario: An active publisher visits the show page of a pending cast they did not author
